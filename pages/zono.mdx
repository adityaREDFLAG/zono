# Get Started
**Go to https://github.com/Zono-Bot/Zono-Full-Release**

# Hosting
Want to host this bot? Download all files and upload them onto https://replit.com. Then go on the project **Secrets** tab. On that tab, add a new secret named "DiscordToken" and set the value to the token of you bot. Then open your **.replit** file and make sure it looks like this:

```py filename=".replit"
# The command that runs the program. Commented out because it is not run when the interpreter command is set
# run = ["python3", "main.py", "alive.html"]
# The primary language of the repl. There can be others, though!
language = "python3"
# The main file, which will be shown by default in the editor.
entrypoint = "main.py"
# A list of globs that specify which files and directories should
# be hidden in the workspace.
hidden = ["venv", ".config", "**/__pycache__", "**/.mypy_cache", "**/*.pyc"]

# Specifies which nix channel to use when building the environment.
[nix]
channel = "stable-21_11"

# Per-language configuration: python3
[languages.python3]
pattern = "**/*.py"
# Tells the workspace editor to syntax-highlight these files as
# Python.
syntax = "python"

  # The command needed to start the Language Server Protocol. For
  # linting and formatting.
[languages.python3.languageServer]
start = "pylsp"

# The command to start the interpreter.

```

Make sure in your REPLIT's Secrets, you have a secret named "DiscordToken" and set the value to your bots token.
Once done, you may run the bot. If there are any errors, please get in contact with me on our Discord server, Zono Hub.


## 24/7 Uptime
To keep the bot online 24/7, use an uptime monitor service like UptimeRobot. UptimeRobot allows you to monitor your bot's availability and sends requests periodically to keep it active. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Go to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) and sign up for an account.
2. After signing up, click on "Add New Monitor" to create a new monitor.
3. Select the "HTTP(s)" monitor type.
4. Set the monitor settings:
   - Friendly Name: Enter a name for your bot.
   - URL (or IP): Enter the URL where your bot is hosted.
   - Monitoring Interval: Choose an interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) for UptimeRobot to send requests to your bot.
5. Click on "Create Monitor" to save the settings.
6. UptimeRobot will now periodically send requests to your bot, helping to keep it online.
